# Next release: WIP

- Load custom substitutions from `/etc/xdg/uniemoji/custom.json` and
  `~/.config/uniemoji/custom.json` (or rather, any dir in the XDG config
  path if you have pyxdg installed, which modern distros do by default)

# 0.3.0: 🔍😕 — 2015-06-15

- Fuzzy search
- Use system default keyboard layout/variant
  (Actually that's a lie! That's what IBus calls the option, but in reality
  what it does is keep the previous layout/variant when you switch. So if
  you're coming from a qwerty IM to uniemoji, you'll get qwerty; if you're
  coming from a dvorak IM, you get dvorak, and so on.)

# 0.2.0: 🕴 ⤆ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ — 2015-04-06

- Update UnicodeData to 7.0
- Include some more symbols
- Add uninstall to Makefile (thanks Stephen Chandler Paul @Lyude)

# 0.1.1: 😳🐛 — 2013-08-27

- Bugfix (first unicode code point range wasn't considered)

# 0.1.0: 🐱🚀 — 2013-01-14

- Intiial release
